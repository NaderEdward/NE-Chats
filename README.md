# NE CHATS (Nader Edward Chats)

I built this web project to expand my skills and knowledge about distributing my code and having it on the internet rather than just on my computer as well as making it for mobile devices rather than for desktops. I used a free server from PythonAnywhere to provide a server where I could implement this project and it runs on [this](https://naderedward.pythonanywhere.com/) link. Due to the limitations of the free server, the database only operates for a short time when I hard refresh the webserver so for any trials contact me by email. 


## Features
- Registering an account
When a user goes to the above link (preferably on mobile) they will be redirected to the login page as the home page has a "Login_reuired" wrap, to access the register page click on the menus button and click on register. You will be asked for your full name, phone number, one of the options for countries (currently only three are available but more can easily be added), a password and its confirmation. If there are no accounts with the same phone number and country then you will be redirected to the home page.
- Log in
You'll go to the login page when the above link is pressed. After entering your login info you'll be redirected to the home page.
- Adding and removing contacts
To access the contacts page you'll find a button in the menu sidebar. This page shows each user's contacts and their details and offers the option to add new contacts by their phone numbers and countries as well as the ability to remove from the contacts already added. Both these options require the user's password as confirmation. Adding or removing a contact sends a notification to that contact that they have been added or removed alongside your phone number and country
- Sending messages and opening chats
In the menu sidebar, there is a contacts section. Clicking on the open button beside each contact will open their chat and load all previous messages. When you are in the chat, you can see all new messages sent by the other user as well as send messages yourself. But to see any messages sent while in the open chat, you'll have to click the reload button beside the send button to refresh the messages feed. Sending a message sends a notification to the recipient that a message has been sent.
- Home page
This is where the latest notifications for each user are shown (the last 5 notifications).

### Coding Languages Used

I used Python, Flask, Javascript and Django for the dynamic aspect of the website, HTML and CSS for the static and design aspects. I used the Bootstrap css library for CSS and HTML classes and pre-coded elements. As well as multiple libraries listed in the requirements.txt file and APIs listed in the acknowledgements.
